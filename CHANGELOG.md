## [Unreleased]

### Breaking Changes

- programs(store): Creating an increase order now requires its final output token to be the position's collateral token, and executing one whose final output token was recorded at creation revalidates the same thing. Creating an order with a different final output token used to succeed and silently ignore the value; it now reverts with `TokenMintMismatched`. Existing orders with an uninitialized final output token are unaffected and keep executing.

### Added

- programs(store): Added the permissionless `set_builder_fee_factor` instruction, with which a User Account owner advertises a builder fee factor on their own account, bounded by the store's `MaxBuilderFeeFactor` (which reads `0` until a config keeper raises it). Emits a `BuilderFeeFactorSet` event.
- sdk(sdk): Added `CreateOrderBuilder::prepare_final_output_token_escrow`, opting an increase order into providing its final output token escrow at creation. The escrow is what a builder fee would be paid out of, so an increase order created without it cannot be given one. Off by default, leaving the previous behavior unchanged.
- sdk(sdk): Added `UserOps::set_builder_fee_factor` for building the instruction.
- programs(store): Added the owner-signed `set_builder_fee` instruction, checkpointing a builder and its advertised fee factor onto one of the owner's own pending position orders. The factor must equal what the builder currently advertises and is re-checked against the store cap, since the cap can be lowered after a rate was legally advertised. Checkpointing a User Account that advertises `0` is how a builder is removed. Emits a `BuilderFeeSet` event carrying the replaced builder and factor.
- programs(utils): Added `OrderKind::is_user_initiated_position`, spelled as an explicit list of the five owner-created position kinds. `is_increase_position() || is_decrease_position()` is not equivalent: the latter also matches `Liquidation` and `AutoDeleveraging`, which must never carry a builder fee.
- sdk(sdk): Added `BuilderFeeOps::set_builder_fee` and the `SetBuilderFee` atomic-group builder for building the instruction.
- sdk(decode): Added `BuilderFeeFactorSet` and `BuilderFeeSet` to `GMSOLCPIEvent`, so the events decode into their typed form instead of `UnknownOwnedData`.
- sdk(decode): Added `BuilderFeeSettled` and `BuilderFeeClaimed` to `GMSOLCPIEvent`, so the events decode into their typed form instead of `UnknownOwnedData`.
- sdk(solana-utils): Added `Bundle::send_all_with_opts_detailed`, returning one `Result` per transaction with stable bundle indices.
- sdk(solana-utils): Added `Error::SendAborted` for unsent transactions after an early bundle abort.
- sdk(solana-utils): Made `compress_send_results` public so callers can map detailed results to the legacy signature list.
- programs(store): Added the permissionless `settle_builder_fee` instruction, which pays an order's recorded builder fee out of its final output token escrow into the builder's claim vault and zeroes the record. Idempotent: a recorded amount of zero, including orders that never had a builder, is an explicit no-op, so it may be called in any order state. The four transferring-path accounts (`final_output_token`, `escrow`, `builder_user`, `claim_vault`) are optional and required only when the recorded amount is non-zero. Emits a `BuilderFeeSettled` event on the transferring path; the no-op emits nothing.
- programs(store): Added the owner-signed `claim_builder_fees` instruction, with which a builder withdraws the balance of its claim vault to a destination token account. Idempotent: a zero-balance vault is an explicit no-op. Not gated by the `BuilderFee` feature flag. Emits a `BuilderFeeClaimed` event on the transferring path; the no-op emits nothing.
- programs(store): Added `Factors::max_builder_fee_factor`, the store-level cap that a User Account's advertised builder fee factor is checked against, which reads `0` until a config keeper raises it. Taken from reserved space (`[u128; 64]` to `[u128; 63]`), so the account layout and size are unchanged. The same field appears in the `gmsol_liquidity_provider`, `gmsol_timelock` and `gmsol_treasury` IDLs, which share the type.
- programs(store): Added `UserHeader::builder_fee_factor`, the factor a User Account advertises to builders. Also taken from reserved space (`[u8; 128]` to `[u8; 112]`), so the account layout and size are unchanged. Present in the `gmsol_liquidity_provider` IDL for the same reason.
- programs(store): Added the `BuilderFeeCharged` event, emitted on execution whenever the order carries a builder (a non-zero checkpointed factor), even when the amount charged against the order's collateral clamps to zero: its presence alone distinguishes "no builder attached" from "builder attached but nothing was collectible". Carries both the computed and the actually charged amounts.
- programs(store): Added the `BuilderFeeSettled` event, carrying both the recorded amount and the amount actually transferred, so any shortfall between them is observable.
- programs(store): Added the `BuilderFeeClaimed` event, emitted when a builder withdraws from its claim vault.
- programs(store): Added nine builder fee error codes, `6129` through `6137`, appended after the existing codes so no existing code shifts: `BuilderFeeFactorExceedsMaxFactor` (6129), `UnsettledBuilderFee` (6130), `BuilderFeeExceedsCollateral` (6131), `BuilderFeeFinalOutputTokenMismatch` (6132), `BuilderFeeSwapTypeNotAllowed` (6133), `BuilderFeeFactorMismatched` (6134), `BuilderFeeOrderKindNotAllowed` (6135), `BuilderFeeFinalOutputTokenNotInitialized` (6136) and `BuilderFeeFinalOutputTokenEscrowNotInitialized` (6137).
- sdk(decode): Added `BuilderFeeCharged` to `GMSOLCPIEvent`, so the event decodes into its typed form instead of `UnknownOwnedData`.
- sdk(sdk): Added the `SettleBuilderFee`, `ClaimBuilderFees` and `SetBuilderFeeFactor` atomic-group builders, completing the set for the four builder fee instructions. Only `set_builder_fee` had one before, so the other three could not be composed into a single transaction with anything else, and the JS surface had nothing to wrap since it is built on the builder layer. `SettleBuilderFee` carries a hint resolvable from the order account; the other two need none, because every account they take is derived from the payer, the store and the mint.

### Changed

- programs(store): An increase order now records its final output token at creation when the escrow is provided, which is what makes it eligible for a builder fee later.
- sdk(sdk): `BuilderFeeOps::settle_builder_fee` now takes the builder layer's `SettleBuilderFeeHint`, and the identically named type that used to sit beside the trait has been removed. Field names and meanings are unchanged; they now hold `StringPubkey` instead of `Pubkey`. Callers passing `None` are unaffected. This mirrors what `set_builder_fee` already did, so the two no longer disagree about where their hint lives.
- sdk(js): `CreateOrderOptions::set_builder_fee` simplified from a per-market `HashMap<marketToken, SetBuilderFeeOptions>` to a single `Option<SetBuilderFeeOptions>`. The same builder and factor apply to every order in the call; callers needing different settings per order should use separate `create_orders_builder` calls.
- sdk(js): `CloseOrderArgs::settle_builder_fee` is now `Option<HashMap<orderAddress, SettleBuilderFeeHint>>`. Callers that do not provide it get the same behaviour as before; callers closing orders that may carry a non-zero builder fee should populate it so the fee is settled before the escrow is closed.
- sdk(solana-utils): Kept the two-argument `Bundle::send_all_with_opts` as a deprecated compatibility wrapper around the detailed API. It still returns the compressed success-signature list, and when multiple transactions fail it returns the **last** real send error (matching prior overwrite semantics; `SendAborted` placeholders are ignored).

- programs: Allowed withdrawals from unauthorized treasury vaults.
- programs: Changed to use the `create_idempotent` instruction instead of `create` to prepare GM vaults when initializing GLV.
- programs: Changed to use the maximized `to_market_token_value` to estimate the price impact after a GLV shift.
- programs: Cancelled the ADL execution fee refund to ensure the fairness of ADL.
- programs: Set `GlvShift::MIN_EXECUTION_LAMPORTS` to `0`.
- programs: The `transfer_referral_code` instruction only update the `next_owner` field of the referral code.
- sdk: Changed to use `Gateway::fetch_signatures_multi` to fetch price signatures for Switchboard pull oracle implementation.
- cli: Implemented instruction buffering and serialization support for the `exchange` command.
- docs: Added the Audits section to the `README.md`.
